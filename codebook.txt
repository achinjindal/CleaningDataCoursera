This dataset contains one row for each unique combination of a subject and an activity. It comprises 68 columns, the first two columns, "Subject" and "Activity" correpond to the participant and the activity being performed respectively. The other 66 columns give the mean value of the corresponding columns. The columns in the dataset are listed below.
